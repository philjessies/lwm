! To test xresources processing, run the following:
! xrdb -merge testXresources
!
! I would recommend doing this inside a VNC session, so your Xwindows session
! is not corrupted.
!
! Important note: these settings are not intended to look beautiful; in fact,
! they look particularly horrible. Rather, they are intended as a test so we
! can easily check that the resource processing is working correctly. Thus,
! they all look and act very differently from the (hopefully nicer) defaults.

! You may need to change the font, in case you do not have this one.
