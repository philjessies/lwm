2018-12-08 (pn) Done a bit of clean-up in here. I've also set up a bunch of
sections, generally from most to least important. At the top we have crashes,
and at the bottom clean-ups.

Right at the bottom of the file there's a cheat sheet of debugging tools.


=== CRASHES ===


=== FUNCTIONAL BREAKAGES ===

For multi-screen displays (xrandr), LWM thinks the total surface space of the
display is a rectangle. If you have a laptop connected to a larger external
monitor, this means there are inaccessible spaces that LWM thinks it can put
windows in.


=== THINGS THAT LOOK SILLY ===

On start-up, every window looks focused.

Focus display bug in Terminator: use shift-alt-t (run command in new tab). This
opens a popup to type or select a command to run. Do that, and hit Return. The
new tab opens, and gets input focus, but the LWM border is drawn as if it
doesn't have focus.

Chrome uses a way of specifying its icon that we don't support. Interestingly,
running 'xprop' on one of the Chrome windows yields a massive ascii-art icon.
We should add support for this.

Application icons aren't scaled, so for some of them (eg firefox) we just
display a weird-looking chunk of their inside. Adding automatic creation of
scaled copies of app icons would be nice, although I don't want to rope in some
massive bloated graphics library to do it.


=== ERROR LOGS ===

LWM produces error messages like these:
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0x1200001 failed: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0x1800001 failed: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0x1a00001 failed: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0x1c00001 failed: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)


=== FEATURES ===

Detect when mouse pointer switches between displays (for multiple xrandr
monitors) and bring up some visual indication of where the pointer has gone.

Make the size of the mouse pointer configurable. Some people have poor vision,
and would benefit from a larger pointer (and 4k displays exacerbate this).


=== CLEANUPS ===

The way the current window is tracked is using a global 'current' pointer and
a 'last_focus'. This is not a good way to deal with the focus history. Not
to mention the fact that keeping pointers to objects can lead to crashes, if
they're not forcibly nulled at the right moment.

The way disp.cc keeps track of the mode is not very OO. Maybe this could be
refactored, so we don't have to have a global 'mode' variable.


=== DEBUGGING TOOLS ===

To get a dump of the window tree:
xwininfo -root -tree

To print details about a window:
xprop -id <id>

Test LWM changes in a VNC session (I use tightvnc). Believe me, testing LWM in
the same X session as you're using to edit its code is a seriously painful
experience.
vncserver -geometry 1600x1200 -name test
vncviewer localhost:1
